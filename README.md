# Educational Keylogger Simulator

This is a safe, browser-based keylogger simulator built with HTML and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental principles of how a keylogger works in a controlled and educational environment.

## How it Works

The simulator uses a JavaScript `keydown` event listener to capture keystrokes made *only* within the webpage. It then displays these keys in a "log" area on the screen.

## Important Note

This is **NOT** a malicious tool. It does not record any activity outside of its own webpage and does not save or transmit any data. It is created purely for educational purposes to help understand a core cybersecurity concept.

## How to Use

1.  Download the `keylogger.html` file.
2.  Open the file in any modern web browser.
3.  Type in the text area to see the simulation in action.
